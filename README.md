# linux-huds
 fixed huds (mostly for linux)

all of these have been tested with kubuntu, and at some point will be tested with GNOME (apparently font rendering is different on gnome, "we'll cross that bridge when we get there" or whatever). </br> right now minor QOL improvements and mostly font resizing will be done, and i'll try not to make any artistic changes.

found a bug i missed? make an issue!</br>
